Note: This would be a Word document template file, but since the current system uses python-docx for programmatic generation, 
this template file is provided as a placeholder for future template-based document generation.

The existing document_generator.py already creates comprehensive investment reports programmatically, 
so this template file is not currently required for the system to function properly.

If template-based generation were to be implemented in the future, this file would contain:
- Client information placeholders ({{client_name}}, {{client_email}}, etc.)
- Financial situation placeholders ({{revenus_mensuels}}, {{patrimoine_total}}, etc.)
- Investment profile placeholders ({{tolerance_risque}}, {{horizon_investissement}}, etc.)
- Recommendation sections with dynamic content placeholders

The current programmatic approach in document_generator.py is more flexible and provides 
better control over document formatting and content generation.
