Note: This would be a Word document template file, but since the current system uses python-docx for programmatic generation, 
this template file is provided as a placeholder for future template-based document generation.

The existing document_generator.py already creates comprehensive mission letters programmatically, 
so this template file is not currently required for the system to function properly.

If template-based generation were to be implemented in the future, this file would contain:
- Client address and contact information placeholders
- Date placeholders
- Investment profile summary placeholders
- Service offering placeholders
- Legal and regulatory compliance text
- Signature blocks and company information

The current programmatic approach in document_generator.py provides better control over 
document structure and allows for dynamic content generation based on client profiles.
